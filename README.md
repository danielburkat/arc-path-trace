# arc-path-trace
A program that determines the path of electric arcs on images using Dijkstra's algorithm.

The script to run the program is called runFindArcPath.m
I included example data in two zipped folders. These contain the images, and the locations of the source and target for the path finding.

The runtime depends on the number of images to analyze. It will take a few minutes to get though the 1000 images so be patient.
